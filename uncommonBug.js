This error occurs when you are using a third-party library that has not been properly integrated into your React Native project.  This can happen for a number of reasons, including incorrect installation, missing dependencies, or conflicts with other libraries. The error message itself may not be very informative, often just stating that a module is not found or that a method is undefined.  The key is identifying the problematic library and making sure it is fully compatible with your React Native version and other dependencies.
