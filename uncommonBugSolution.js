The solution involves carefully reviewing the library's installation instructions and ensuring all dependencies are correctly installed.   It's crucial to use a compatible version of the library with your React Native environment. This may involve checking package.json, verifying that the library is properly linked (if required), and ensuring there are no version conflicts between your dependencies.  Additional steps might include cleaning your project's cache and reinstalling node modules.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
// Correctly import the hypothetical library after proper installation
import HypotheticalComponent from 'react-native-hypothetical-lib';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This component uses the hypothetical library correctly</Text>
      <HypotheticalComponent />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
