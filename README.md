This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky bug in React Native: issues stemming from improper integration of third-party libraries.  The `uncommonBug.js` file illustrates a scenario where a module is not found due to a dependency problem, leading to runtime errors.  The solution, provided in `uncommonBugSolution.js`, shows how to correctly install and link the library, resolving the error. This example uses a hypothetical library called 'react-native-hypothetical-lib' for demonstration purposes.  Replace this with your specific library.
